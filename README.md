# DSE Assignment 4
The report can either be looked at using either the .html file or the .ipynb file. Below are details concerning the other files contained in the repository for this assignment:
- metrics_#P.csv where # = [1,2,4,8] are csv files exported by the job submission file containing the loss and runtimes over 30 epochs for 1, 2, 4 and 8 processes
- assignment4.py is the python code file containing the code for building and training the convolutional neural network
- assignment4.pbs is the job submission script in which I specified the number of processes for each run 
- MNIST is a directory containing the necessary data to train the model 
- Job_logs is a directory containing the output logs for numerous runs of the job submission script (don't bother looking at these... they are ugly out of memory errors mostly... ew)
